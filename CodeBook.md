Variables. 

x_train = It is the 'X' data from the Training data set
y_train = It is the 'y' data from the Training data set
subject_train = It is the 'subject' data from the Training data set
x_test = It is the 'X' data from the Test data set
y_test = It is the 'y' data from the Test data set
subject_test = It is the 'subject' data from the Test data set
all_data = this is the total combined data file

Transformations
1. Activities codes were renamed to reflect the names such as laying, standing and so on.
2. Subjects were renamed to reflect the measurement such as tBodyAcc-mean(), tBodyAcc-mean() and so on.
